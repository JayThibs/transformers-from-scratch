# Transformers from Scratch

This is repository for learning about building transformer models from scratch. Transformer models can be used quite easily via fine-tuning the models using something like Huggingface's `transformers` library, so it can be quite easy to avoid learning about any of the particularities concerning transformer models. Well, I want to learn more about transformer models and how to build them from scratch, so this is a repository for experimenting with that.

Most of my notes will be in Roam Research and Mind Maps, so this repository will only contain jupyter notebooks for running the code unless somebody explicitly asks that I edit my notes and share them.
